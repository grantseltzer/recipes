# Miami Rolls

## Base Recipe:

```
Ratner's Onion Rolls

Dough
1 package active dry yeast or 2 1/2 teaspoons instant yeast
1 cup warm water 
2 tablespoons sugar
1 1/2 teaspoons salt 
3 large eggs 
6 tablespoons oil
4-5 cups all purpose flour
Egg Wash
1 egg, well beaten, for wash 

Filling
1 cup finely chopped onion 
1 teaspoons salt 
1 tablespoon poppy seeds
1 1/2 teaspoons caraway seeds 
1 cup dry bread crumbs 
1/4 cup oil 

In a bowl whisk the yeast in lukewarm water. Stir in sugar, salt, eggs, oil and enough flour to form a stiff dough. Knead on a floured surface until smooth and elastic, about 5 minutes. Place dough in a greased bowl and turn to grease top. Let rise, covered, in a warm dry place until doubled in bulk, about 1 hour. from the other side.

Punch down and knead on a floured surface and roll dough into a 18 x 24 inch oblong. Cut dough into twelve 6Ã—13 inch pieces. To prepare filling, mix all ingredients in a bowl. Spoon 3/4 of the mixture over dough. Fold 1/3 of the dough over onions and fold 1/3 over again

Place rolls, seam side down, on a greased cookie sheet. Flatten rolls until they are five inches long.

Cut rolls in half.

Brush rolls with the egg wash and sprinkle with remaining onion mixture. At this point, you can freeze the dough for later use

Let rise, covered, in a warm place until doubled in bulk, about 30 minutes.

Bake rolls in a preheated hot oven (400 degree F) for 15-30 minutes.

Frozen Rolls:

When ready to bake, place frozen rolls on a greased cookie sheet and let rise, uncovered, in a warm place until doubled in bulk, about 1 hour.

Bake rolls in a preheated hot oven (400 degree F) for 15-30 minutes.

# First Attempt (4/14/20)

## Dough Ingredients

```
20g Active Dry Yeast [2.85%]

27g granulated sugar [3.85%]

6g kosher salt [0.85%]

700g all purpose flour [100%]

3 large eggs [absent]

6 tbs E.V.O.O [absent]
```

## Filling Ingredients
```
1 Large yellow onion (chopped just slightly larger than diced)
Sprinkling of salt
2 tbs E.V.O.O

Everything bagel seasoning (EBS)
Additional egg for eggwash
```

## Instructions
```
Whisk yeast with one cup of warm water and a pinch of sugar. 
Let sit to activate for 5-10 minutes. 
Add sugar, salt, and eggs. 
Stir/beat until well combined. 
Add Flour a little at a time. (Should develop a stiff, slightly sticky dough)
Knead for 5 minutes until dough is smooth.
Put in greased and covered bowl in the oven (off) until doubled in size (took about 1:30)

Meanwhile carmelize chopped onion by cooking it in a little bit of olive oil with sprinkling of salt on low heat for 20 minutes or so. Onion should be golden and soft, not too much liquid. Can add a little fresh olive oil at the end

Stretch out dough into even oblong shape. 
Cut into 12 individual pieces. 
Put spoonful of filling at center of each piece.
Sprinkle EBS in as well.
Fold each side of each piece over (1/3, then 1/3).
Put each roll, seam side down, on a parchment lined baking sheet.
Cut each in half.
Let sit in oven until doubled in size. (Took about 45 minutes)
Take out, and preheat oven to 400 degrees.
Egg wash all rolls.
Spoon remaining onion filling on top.
Sprinkle plenty of EBS on top.
Bake for 20 minutes until nice and golden on top.
Let cool, onions are really hot.

Lesson learned for next time:
- More like a hamburger bun texture/taste, but with onion. Want it to be stringier, moister, sweeter, and more yellow.
- Want to add:
    - An additional egg yolk
    - Bread flour over regular flour
    - More sugar
    - More kneading
    - More time to proof (really let it double in size)
    - Honey?


# Second Attempt (5/25/20)

Used propotions from challah recipe instead of iterating on previous one. Feels like a better starting point.


```
300g AP Flour

300g Bread Flour

20g Active Dry Yeast 

1/4c Vegetable Oil

60g Sugar (+ pinch for yeast) 

5g Salt

3 eggs (one is for egg wash)

1 egg yolk

1 large yellow onion
```


```
- In a large bowl, stir to combine yeast with 15g of sugar and 1.75 cups of warm water. Let sit for ~5 minutes until bubbly and active. 

- Whisk oil into yeast.

- Whisk 2 large eggs + 1 yolk into mixture, one at a time.

- Whisk sugar and salt into mixutre a little a time.

- Gradually add flour a little at time until dough holds together well enough to knead with hands.

- Turn dough onto floured surface and knead thoroughly until it passes a window pane test. 

- Grease a large bowl, place the dough into it then flip the dough over so every side is oiled. Cover with plastic wrap and let rise in a warm place until just about doubled in size. (Can use the turned-off oven. Can also place a small pot of boiling water at the bottom of the oven to provide extra moisture).

- Allow to rise until doubled in size

- Roll out into large oblong shape, cut into 8 even pieces

- Individually flatten each piece, place slices of raw onion, drizzle of olive oil, and seasoning in center.

- Fold into pockets, place on a tray seam side down.

- Egg wash the top, allow to rise again until doubled in size.

- Preheat oven to 400 degrees, egg wash again and cover in seasoning and more raw onion.

- Bake for ~20 minutes until nice and brown on top.

Came out pretty good. Next time I'd add another egg yolk or two and carmelize the onion instead of using raw ones.


# Third Attempt (6/05/20)

Came out not very flavorful and too big and airy for target texture. After adding 2 egg yolks the dough was just too sticky so I had to add so much more flour. Beautiful texture for a sandwich but needs to be a lot denser and stringier. 

I'd try the original 300g of each type of flour, and only add 1 more egg yolk. Also I'd cut the yeast, this rose a lot and became very airy. Maybe 15g instead of 20g at first. To make up for less flour, need to use less water. Maybe start with half (can always add more if it's dry).

# Fourth Attempt (7/19/20)

```
300g AP Flour

300g Bread Flour

20g Active Dry Yeast 

1/4c Vegetable Oil

60g Sugar (+ pinch for yeast) 

5g Salt

3 eggs (one is for egg wash)

2 egg yolk

1 large yellow onion
```

```
- In a large bowl, stir to combine yeast with 15g of sugar and 3/4 cup of warm water. Let sit for ~5 minutes until bubbly and active. 

- Whisk oil into yeast.

- Whisk 2 large eggs + 2 yolk into mixture, one at a time.

- Whisk sugar and salt into mixutre a little a time.

- Gradually add flour a little at time until dough holds together well enough to knead with hands.

- Turn dough onto floured surface and knead very thoroughly until it passes a window pane test. (I typically knead it for 15 minutes straight)

- Grease a large bowl, place the dough into it then flip the dough over so every side is oiled. Cover with plastic wrap and let rise in a warm place until just about doubled in size. (Can use the turned-off oven. Can also place a small pot of boiling water at the bottom of the oven to provide extra moisture).

- Allow to rise until doubled in size.

- Break up the dough into individual balls that are 80g each.

- Individually flatten each piece to an oblong shape, about eighth of an inch thick. Place a spoonful of caramelized onions across the center. Fold the long ends into one another so they just overlap. Fold up the other individual sides to seal the onions in. The assembled miami roll should big a small rectangle a little smaller than your closed fist. 

- Arrange the miami rolls so they have about a half an inch of space between them on a parchment paper lined cookie sheet. It is desirable for them to fuse together a little bit when rising/baking.

- Egg wash the top and sides of all of the rolls.

- Allow to rise again until doubled in size. About 30-45 minutes.

- Preheat oven to 400 degrees.

- Egg wash again and sprinkle dried onion flakes on top.

- Bake for ~15 minutes until nice and brown on top.

These are really close. They don't have that strong of a flavor. They're a great moist roll but not as dense as The Bakery's. Besides that they're great.

I would add a little bit more oil, perhaps 1/3 instead of 1/4. Maybe i'd try olive oil instead as well, just to give it more flavor and more color. I'd also add more salt, 10-15g more. Also some more sugar, perhaps 80g instead of 60g. Also i'd try Anatto seed for yellow coloring.
