# Ingredients



```
45 grams all-purpose flour
30 grams Dutch-processed cocoa powder
¾ teaspoon baking powder
½ teaspoon kosher salt
225 grams bittersweet chocolate (70 percent), broken or chopped into pieces
55 grams unsalted butter (1/2 stick)
2 large eggs, at room temperature
100 grams granulated sugar
55 grams light brown sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
115 grams bittersweet chocolate chips or chopped chocolate (about 2/3 cup)

```

## Steps
```

Step 1
Heat oven to 350 degrees. Combine flour, cocoa powder, baking powder and salt in a medium bowl, and whisk to combine. Set aside.

Step 2
Combine the 8 ounces bittersweet chocolate and the butter in a small heatproof bowl that fits on top of a small saucepan without falling in. Bring 1 inch of water to a boil in the saucepan over high, reduce to a simmer, then set the bowl on top. Stir occasionally until completely melted. Remove bowl from saucepan to cool slightly.

Step 3
Combine eggs, granulated sugar and light brown sugar in the bowl of an electric stand mixer fitted with the whip attachment. Beat on medium speed to combine, scraping down the sides once. Increase speed to high and beat until pale and fluffy, about 5 minutes, scraping the bowl as needed. Add vanilla. Beat to combine.

Step 4
Add the melted chocolate mixture and beat on medium speed to combine. Add the flour mixture and beat on low speed until just combined. Remove bowl from mixer, scrape sides and fold a few times to make sure everything is well combined. Add the 4 ounces bittersweet chocolate chips and fold to combine.

Step 5
Use a small cookie scoop to scoop dough (which will be pretty runny) into generous 1-tablespoon portions. Transfer to parchment-lined baking sheets, setting each scoop 3 inches apart. Bake until surface is crinkled and edges are firm, 8 to 10 minutes, rotating sheets from front to back and top to bottom halfway through.

Step 6
Let cookies cool for a few minutes on the baking sheets, and transfer them to a wire rack to cool further. Scoop any remaining dough onto one of the baking sheets — it’s O.K. to reuse the parchment — and repeat. Cookies will keep in an airtight container at room temperature for 3 to 4 days.
