## Steps
```
- In a large bowl, stir to combine yeast with 15g of sugar and 1.75 cups of warm water. Let sit for ~5 minutes until bubbly and active. 

- Whisk oil into yeast.

- Whisk 4 large eggs into mixture, one at a time.

- Whisk sugar and salt into mixutre a little a time.

- Gradually add dough a little at time until dough holds together well enough to knead with hands.

- Turn dough onto floured surface and knead thoroughly until it passes a window pane test. 

- Grease a large bowl, place the dough into it then flip the dough over so every side is oiled. Cover with plastic wrap and let rise in a warm place until just about doubled in size. (Can use the turned-off oven. Can also place a small pot of boiling water at the bottom of the oven to provide extra moisture).

// The recipe this was copied from specified to punch it back down after the first rise, and let it rise for another hour again. We didn't do this and it turned out perfect, but could be worth trying. 

- Cut dough into 12 even pieces.

- Roll out each piece evenly and braid 2x 6-braid challahs.

- (One can be frozen at this point, when you want to bake it let it thaw/rise for at least 5 hours)

- Beat an egg and brush each challah with egg wash.

- Let rise for another hour or so until puffed up significantly. 

- Preheat oven to 375 degrees.

- Egg wash challah again and sprinkle on toppings. Press gently to adhere topping into challah.

- Bake in middle of oven for 35 minutes or until golden.

- Cool loaves on a rack.
